.TH MDRO "1"  "2022-04-01" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "HAL User's Manual"
.SH NAME
mdro \- manual only Digital Read Out (DRO)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mdro
[\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-p\fR \fIpoint_size\fR] [\fB\-m\fR] [\fB\-ini\fR \fIini_file_name\fR] [\fB\-l\fR] [\fIaxes\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmdro\fR is a manual only DRO providing functionality similar to a
traditional manual DRO. It is most useful for manual machines 
converted to CNC. It allows the user to manually control the
machine while continuing to use the DRO scales on the axes.
The GUI can be sized to match the user's screen. It is
mouse-only and touchscreen friendly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBv\fR 
Turn on verbose debug prints. \fB-vv\fR is even more verbose.
.TP
\fBp\fR \fIpoint_size\fR
Set the point size for the text in the application. This option controls
the overall size of the window on the screen. Default is 20. Typical values 
range from 20 to 30.
.TP
\fBm\fR
Convert inches to mm. Convert DRO hardware reporting inches to mm in the display
fields.
.TP
\fBini\fR \fIini_file_name\fR
This option is provided by linuxcnc when the program is
started from the \fIDISPLAY\fR entry in a linuxcnc .ini file. It is used to
find the \fIPOSTGUI_HALFILE\fR entry and optionally the \fIRS274NGC\fR
\fIPARAMETER_FILE\fR entry in the .ini file.
.TP
\fBl\fR
Load G54 through G57 coordinates from the .var file referenced in the .ini
file. Requires the \fBini\fR option.
.TP
\fIaxes\fR
this option is used to specify the names of the axes handled by the program.
The default is "XYZ". A four axis mill would use "XYZA", and a lathe with a two
axis DRO might use "XZ".

.SH SCREEN CONFIGURATION
The top of the screen includes a row for each axis specified in \fIaxes\fR. Data in
these rows are derived from signals on the \fImdro.axis.n\fR pins that are
instantiated when \fBmdro\fR is started. Each row includes buttons that
allow the value to be be zeroed, to be halved or a new value to be entered. There is
also a button that enables the index zero process for that axis.

The screen includes buttons that allow the selection of one of four different
coordinate systems. The machine coordinate system can also be selected though it
cannot be changed. 

The screen includes a keypad that can be used with a mouse or a touch screen to
enter coordinate data.

Finally, buttons on the screen allow the selection of inch or mm data display.

.SH USAGE
\fBmdro\fR is normally started from the \fIDISPLAY\fR entry in a dedicated
\fBmdro.ini\fR file.  The .ini file and the associated HAL files  should
include the pins and signals that support the DRO scales. The HAL hookup to 
\fBmdro\fR must be done in the \fIPOSTGUI_HALFILE\fR referenced in the .ini file.
Note that \fIaxes\fR parameter and the other options can be specified on the
\fIDISPLAY\fR line. 

Using an example of "XYZA" for an \fIaxes\fR argument, these pins will be created
when \fBmdro\fR starts:

 mdro.axis.0
 mdro.axis.1
 mdro.axis.2
 mdro.axis.3
 mdro.index-enable.0
 mdro.index-enable.1
 mdro.index-enable.2
 mdro.index-enable.3

In this example, the first row will be labeled "X" and will show the data associated
with pin mdro.axis.0. In many configurations, mdro.axis.0 can be hooked directly
to x-pos-fb in the POSTGUI-HAL file. The index pins should be hooked to the
corresponding index-enable pins from the DRO.

\fBmdro\fR can also be started via a "loaduser" command in a HAL file for a trial.
